            <h1>Box 1</h1>
            <p>Problem Understanding: The first step is to clearly understand the problem that needs to be solved
                and the objectives of the system. This includes defining performance metrics such as speed,
                accuracy, resource usage, and scalability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>Box 2</h1>
            <p>Algorithm Design: Based on the problem understanding, design as algorithm that addresses the requirements while
                optimizing performance. This may include choosing the appropriate data structure, selecting efficient
            algorithms, and designing algorithms with low time and space complexity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h1>Box 3</h1>
        <p>Optimization Techniques: Implement optimization technies to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
            This could include algorithmic optimizations such as reducing redundant computations, minimizing memory usage,
            and leveraging parallelism to concurrency where applicable.</p>
